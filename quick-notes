Install the beta package:
Arch AUR

Install python-vdf-solstice from AUR if you haven't already using the AUR helper of your choice (eg. with Paru the command is paru -S python-vdf-solstice). If pacman prompts you to delete existing python-vdf package, allow it to do so.

Download the PKGBUILD file from protontricks-git either manually or using the AUR helper of your choice (eg. with Paru the command is paru -G protontricks-git).

Change the following line in PKGBUILD from:

source=('git+https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks.git')

to

source=('git+https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks.git#branch=appinfo_v29')

Build and install the package by running the following commands in the directory with the PKGBUILD file:

makepkg
sudo pacman -U protontricks-git-*.tar.zst

// I could never get this working on Proton 9, it always crashes 35% into animation generation. Switch the compatibility to Proton 8 and it should work, just remember to switch back to Proton 9 afterwards
Put Nemesis files in %BASEDIR%/tools/Nemesis
set up the executable in MO2
Launch Nemesis, update engine, generate behavior
if any Nemesis dependent animations are added, you must update engine and regenerate behavior
If any Nemesis dependent animations are removed, you must DELETE the Nemesis_Behavior directory, launch Nemesis and recheck all required mods, update engine and generate
MOVE Nemesis behavior directory out of overwrite/ and into mods/Nemesis Behavior/
